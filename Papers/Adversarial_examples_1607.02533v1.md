* An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified
very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier
to misclassify it.

* Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be
used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has
no access to the underlying model
