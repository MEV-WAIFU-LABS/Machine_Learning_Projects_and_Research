# Curated Resources on ETL, Machine Learning, and ML Pipelines

```
The morale of this repository is to cover resources for deploying Machine learning
in production environments, a task that includes data sourcing, data ingestion, data 
transformation, pre-processing data for use in training, training a model, and hosting 
the model. 
```

Three conceptual steps are how most data pipelines are designed and structured:

* **Extract**: sensors wait for upstream data sources.
* **Transform**: business logic is applied (e.g. filtering, grouping, and aggregation to translate raw data into analysis-ready datasets).
* **Load**: processed data is transported to a final destination.
