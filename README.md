## tensorflow for deep learning

<br>

### ðŸ‘¾ my old ml notebooks and tensorflow/numpy small projects:

<br>

* **[ml notebooks](Notebooks)**: my jupyter notebooks with ml models
* **[tensorflow examples](TensorFlow)**: tensorflow learning examples
* **[caffe](Caffee)**: an example using caffe library on docker container
* **[deep art](Deep_Art)**: my deep learning generated art models
* **[ml numpy](Numpy)**: my code and examples using numpy
