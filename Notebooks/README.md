### installing and running these notebooks


<br>


install any dependences for [jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). for example, on a debian-based linux box:

<br>

```shell
apt-get install build-essential python3-dev
pip install jupyter
```

<br>

on the notebook directory, simply run:

<br>

```shell
jupyter notebook
```
